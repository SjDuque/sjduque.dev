This outside truth is called an <em>axiom</em>.</p> <p>To be able to count from 1 to 9, you must first assert that the digits 1 through 9 exist. You cannot <em>prove</em> the existence of those numbers, instead you must <em>assume</em> they exist before you can count.</p> <h1 id="what-is-religion">What is religion?</h1> <p>Every <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/religion"><strong>religion</strong></a> is built upon principles, or <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/axiom"><strong>axioms</strong></a>, that need not be proven outside of its system of <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/belief"><strong>belief</strong></a>. Often referred to as <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/faith"><strong>faith</strong></a>, it takes the form of rules that govern and justify the followers’ existence.</p> <p>For the Abrahamic religions, in reductive terms, one follows a set of rules established by <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/scripture"><strong>scripture</strong></a>; subject to interpretation, scripture dictates what one should eat, how one should act in public, how the universe was created, what a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soul"><strong>soul</strong></a> is, and many more aspects of life that often require a higher power to explain.</p> <p>The controversy that surrounds religion is rooted in uncertainty, and that uncertainty is founded on asserted axioms. The belief relies on those claimed axioms, and those axioms then rely on the belief to reaffirm.</p> <p>In other words:</p> <blockquote> <p>God <em>proves</em> the existence of Himself <em>because</em> He exists.</p> </blockquote> <p>For the mathematical thinkers:</p> <blockquote> <p>The number one <em>proves</em> the existence of itself <em>because</em> it exists.</p> </blockquote> <h1 id="is-math-a-religion">Is math a religion?</h1> <p>Yes, <em>math is a religion</em> and, by extension, <em>science is, too.</em> <br/> The following is a thought experiment involving particle theory.</p> <p>One cannot prove the existence of atoms without first justifying what they are made of.<br/> <em>Atoms are composed of subatomic particles: <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/proton"><strong>protons</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/neutron"><strong>neutrons</strong></a>, and <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/electron"><strong>electrons</strong></a>.</em></p> <p>Going even deeper, what are the subatomic particles made of? <br/> <em>Subatomic particles are composed of <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/quark"><strong>quarks</strong></a>.</em></p> <p>Then what are quarks made of? <br/> <em>Quarks are composed of…</em></p> <p>Continuing this line of questioning, eventually you should resolve the meaning of the universe. Unfortunately, the reality is that physicists still rely on fundamental axioms, or <em>principles</em>, for which they build the rest of their study upon. In this case, the existence of <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/elementary%20particle"><strong>elementary particles</strong></a>. That isn’t to say there isn’t <em>proof</em>, however, there is <em>faith</em> involved; faith that their currently asserted axioms are true.</p> <p>One could argue that science isn’t based on faith, instead it’s based on the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/scientific%20method"><strong>scientific method</strong></a>. After all, the scientific method follows a series of rules to obtain an objective explanation. Ironically, the scientific method is itself based on an <em>axiom</em>, the idea that objectivity <em>can</em> be determined in an uncertain universe.</p> <p>The goal isn’t to say science should be rejected, rather, to bring into discussion that <em>every belief</em> is prone to the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Godel%27s%20theorem"><strong>Incompleteness Thereom</strong></a>.</p> <h1 id="psychology">Psychology</h1> <p>From a psychologist’s perspective, the human mind operates as a machine. The brain operates using logic that it builds through observation. This logic is built upon several <em>principles</em> depending on what is learned, and from that logic a reality is simulated within the brain. This simulated reality could be seen as a <em>religious interpretation</em> of what the person <em>perceives</em> the universe to be.</p> <p>For example:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>If a Christian won the lottery, they might thank the will of God, while a mathematician the grace of probability, and an astrologist the alignment of the stars.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>All justify <em>how</em> they won, and their logic within their simulated reality is secure. However, you might expect a sour response when you ask one winner what they think of the other two’s justifications.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog-posts"/><category term="philosophy"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How the incompleteness theorem relates to religion, and why science is a religion.]]></summary></entry></feed>
