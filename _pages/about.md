Just your typical hippie computer-scientist at UT Austin.

**Currently obsessed with:** studying cognitive science and exploring the moral implications of artificial consciousness.

**Currently reading:** <a href="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu">A.I.</a>, <a href="https://hefferon.net/linearalgebra/">linear algebra</a>, and <a href="http://www.wheelockslatin.com">latin</a>.

**Currently working on:** getting a job, finishing my research projects, and writing my philosophical A.I. story.
